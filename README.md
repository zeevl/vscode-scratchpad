# Scratchpad README

Simple Scratchpad for quick notes.

This project was forked from the awesome [vscode-scratchpad](https://github.com/awesomektvn/vscode-scratchpad) for markdown support.

# Usage
1. Install this plugin :)
2. Press F1, search for "Scratchpad.md"
3. Update "scratchpadmd.path" to specify the file path you want to use. (Optional)
3. Add key bindings (Optional) .
    - Open key bindings settings file:
        + Open Command Palette (Ctrl+P)
        + Search for 'Open keyboard shortcuts'
    - Add and save you key bindings. For example:
```
// Place your key bindings in this file to overwrite the defaults
[
    { "key": "ctrl+shift+.",   "command": "extension.openScratchpadMd", "when": "editorTextFocus" }
]
```
4. Enjoy! :)
